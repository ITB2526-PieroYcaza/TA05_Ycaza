# My Project Portfolio

This repository contains a personal technical portfolio website focused on systems administration, automation, monitoring, and infrastructure projects.
The site is designed with a clean, minimalist, and responsive approach, intended to showcase technical skills, project structure, and good documentation practices.

## Overview

The portfolio presents a set of featured projects and project families, each describing fictitious but realistic IT solutions commonly found in professional environments.

The main emphasis of the project is on:

* Clear technical explanations
* Structural consistency
* Clean UI/UX design
* Adaptability to different devices
* Maintainable and scalable code

The project is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without external frameworks, to demonstrate solid web development fundamentals.
