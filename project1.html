   <h2>Project explanation</h2>




<p>
  This project arises from the need to manage mixed infrastructures from a single control point,
  reducing dependency on manual access to each server. It is designed for professional environments
  where Linux and Windows servers coexist with different roles and levels of criticality.
</p>




<p>
  The solution allows remote command execution, application of standardized configurations,
  software installation and updates, service and system restarts, and operational state validation
  in a centralized manner.
</p>




<p>
  Priority was given to consistency, security, and traceability of actions, ensuring that every
  intervention is logged and reproducible across environments. The project also aims to minimize
  human error and speed up routine maintenance tasks for system administrators.
</p>




<p>
  The project was structured into several well-defined layers to separate responsibilities and
  simplify maintenance. First, secure remote access to Linux servers was established using SSH with
  public key authentication, disabling insecure access methods.
</p>




<p>
  For Windows systems, PowerShell Remoting was configured, adjusting execution policies and
  permissions to ensure controlled access. Ansible was used as the main automation tool for Linux
  environments, creating modular and reusable playbooks for common tasks.
</p>




<p>
  Python was used as an orchestration language to coordinate task execution, validate pre- and
  post-states, and handle errors. A server inventory was designed to classify nodes by environment,
  operating system, and role.
</p>




<p>
  Basic error handling and rollback mechanisms were implemented to prevent inconsistent states.
  Finally, all operational procedures were documented and tested across different scenarios.
</p>




<p>
  This project, demonstrates the value of automation in modern system administration. It
  significantly reduces manual intervention time, improves configuration consistency, facilitates
  infrastructure scalability, and provides a solid foundation for more complex enterprise
  environments.
